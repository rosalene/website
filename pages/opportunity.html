						The Opportunity
					</h1>
					<p>“If you have come here to help me, you are wasting your time. But if you have come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together.” -- Indigenous Australian artist Lilla Watson is credited with the quote, but prefers that it be credited to the collective aboriginal activist groups she was a part of.
		</p>
					<p>This statement of meaning points to the opportunity that unites us in this work. We see a tremendous opportunity to unite with all people across our shared core values. At the most fundamental and operational level, this value is for sustainable human development.  
		
		</p>
					<p>Overlaying this value of sustainable development is the complex web of policy, geopolitical power plays, and allocation of resources. The details of which point to the prioritization of operationalizing values. 
		</p>
					<p>At the base level, we take the opportunity to ask, what can shared humanity in the age of globalization look like? If the narrative around contributions, dignity, and expert knowledge were to be framed contextually irrespective of…. We see the marginalization of demographics of people and environments at cross purposes with the desire to live in alignment with this core value. 
		</p>
					<p>The intricate dance of carbon dioxide absorbing and releasing from the lungs of the planet is one that climate models are tenuous at predicting. </p>
					<p>The opportunity to work together to preserve and conserve land 
		
		</p>
					<p>80% of the total species on earth reside on only 18% of the land’s surface. These biodiversity hotspots around equatorial zones are largely inhabited by Indigenous people, over 300 million in number, who are the native stewards of this land. These people have expert knowledge and wisdom rooted in deep history. Indigenous people  are also keepers for the majority of the world’s  cultural diversity--for example, 96% of known languages—half of which predicted to go extinct this century—are spoken by indigenous people. 
		</p>
					<p>Inequality in Ecuador disproportionately affects indigenous people—chronic poverty, pointing to gaps in access to education and organized around gender and skilled labor coupled with increasing demand on natural resources in one of the world’s most biodiverse regions, is often in tensionwith indigenous rights under current models of development. Coupled with the history of global market exclusion in the region, these facts point to the need for a new model. 
		</p>
					<p>O idea is a development model in response to the extreme marginality of these people. 
		</p>
					<p>As a development solution, our schools offer critical economic benefits to indigenous communities. They contribute to the development of sustainable infrastructure on indigenous land, access to basic services, sustainable employment and economic well-being. 
		</p>
					<p>In summary, the endangerment of indigenous language and culture and the unmatched poverty of the world’s most marginalized populations is a burden felt beyond the isolation of indigenous communities. While indigenous people caretake 80% of the earth’s biodiversity, they are more resource poor than 85% of the earth’s population by enormous margins. Language, perhaps one of the oldest and most prized tools, has played a key evolutionary role in the innovation and transformation of humankind. As repositories for living knowledge, languages represent a map of the diverse territory’s humans have traversed across evolution. Currently, the many 7,000 languages spoken worldwide are immediately endangered and disappearing, many of which are no longer being taught to living </p>
					<p>descendants[1]. By leveraging this innovative capacity of knowledge exchange through language our solution will bring the value of ancestral knowledge to bear on modern society’s reach for sustainability. There is immense purpose and need to safeguard earth’s wealth of biocultural knowledge and biodiverse regions. We are answering an urgent call that our team, our indigenous partners, and many around the world hear, and this proposal is our opportunity to respond with something of value.
